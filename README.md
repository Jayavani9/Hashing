# Hashing

Isomor.java contains the solution to problem : 
205. Isomorphic Strings
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

The solution is given in 2 ways:
1. Using 2 Hashmaps.
2. Using a HashMap and a HashSet.
3. Using a single HashMap
